Just a simple project to play around with global variables and to use form in context of php.
Also I used a bit of bootstrap here.
Main goals of this project are:

The form should consist of:

- A text input for user’s name
- A text input for user’s email address
- A drop down to select user’s issue (Query, Feedback, Complaint, Other)
- A text area for user’s comment
- The form will post to a second page which will display the information in an easy to read format.
- There are more optional conditions to add challenge and/or better functionality to your form below

Extra challenge:

- Make the text area a WYSIWYG. (Use Summernote or CKEditor for example).
- Add an edit button to the second page, send the data back to the form, and autofill the data back into the fields.
